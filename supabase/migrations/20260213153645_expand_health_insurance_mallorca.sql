<h2>Introduction: Why Health Insurance in Mallorca Matters for Expats</h2>

<p>Mallorca, the crown jewel of Spain''s Balearic Islands, has long been one of Europe''s most desirable destinations for expatriates. With its Mediterranean climate, world-class beaches, vibrant cultural scene, and relatively affordable cost of living compared to Northern Europe, it''s no wonder that tens of thousands of foreign nationals call this island home. But one of the most critical decisions any expat must make when relocating to Mallorca is choosing the right health insurance. Getting this wrong can lead to unexpected medical bills running into thousands of euros, gaps in coverage during emergencies, or even complications with your residency application.</p>

<p>Spain''s healthcare system is consistently ranked among the best in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) placed Spain 7th globally in its landmark health systems ranking, and the country boasts one of the highest life expectancies in Europe. However, navigating the dual public-private system as a foreigner requires careful planning, especially given the unique considerations that come with living on an island.</p>

<p>This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about <strong>health insurance in Mallorca for expats and residents</strong>, from understanding the public system to comparing the top private insurers, understanding costs by age group, and knowing how to file a claim. Whether you''re a digital nomad, a retiree, a family with children, or a young professional, this article will help you make an informed decision.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Spanish Healthcare System</h2>

<h3>The Dual Public-Private Model</h3>

<p>Spain operates a dual healthcare system consisting of the public <em>Sistema Nacional de Salud</em> (SNS) and a thriving private healthcare sector. The public system is funded through social security contributions and general taxation, and it provides universal coverage to eligible residents. The private sector complements the public system by offering faster access, more choice, and additional services like single rooms and English-speaking doctors.</p>

<p>In the Balearic Islands, the public health service is managed by the <em>Servei de Salut de les Illes Balears</em> (IB-Salut). This regional authority operates hospitals including Son Espases (the main teaching hospital in Palma), Hospital de Manacor, Hospital Son Llatzer, Hospital Comarcal d''Inca, and numerous health centres (<em>centros de salud</em>) and clinics across the island.</p>

<h3>Public Healthcare: Who Is Eligible?</h3>

<p>Eligibility for Spain''s public healthcare system depends on your residency status, employment situation, and nationality. Here are the main pathways:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Employed or self-employed workers (aut&oacute;nomos):</strong> If you work and pay social security contributions in Spain, you and your dependents are automatically entitled to public healthcare. You''ll receive a <em>tarjeta sanitaria</em> (health card) from your local health centre.</li>
  <li><strong>EU/EEA/Swiss citizens with EHIC/GHIC:</strong> European Health Insurance Card holders can access emergency and necessary public healthcare during temporary stays. For long-term residents, you''ll need to register in the social security system or use the <em>convenio especial</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Retirees with an S1 form:</strong> If you receive a state pension from another EU country, the S1 form entitles you to full public healthcare in Spain, with costs recharged to your home country. Post-Brexit UK retirees who were registered before December 31, 2020 retain this right under the Withdrawal Agreement.</li>
  <li><strong>Convenio Especial:</strong> Non-working residents who don''t qualify through employment or an S1 can pay into the public system through the <em>convenio especial</em>. This costs approximately &euro;60/month for those under 65 and &euro;157/month for those 65 and over (rates subject to change).</li>
  <li><strong>Universal coverage provision:</strong> Spain''s 2018 Royal Decree-Law 7/2018 restored universal healthcare access, meaning that in practice, even those without formal entitlement can access emergency care and basic services at public facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>When Public Healthcare May Not Be Enough</h3>

<p>While the public system provides excellent clinical care, there are situations where expats may find it insufficient:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Long waiting times for specialist appointments (weeks to months in some cases)</li>
  <li>Limited choice of doctor or hospital</li>
  <li>Language barriers, as most public system staff speak Spanish or Catalan</li>
  <li>Shared hospital rooms with limited privacy</li>
  <li>Some dental, optical, and mental health services are not fully covered</li>
  <li>Non-EU residency visa applications typically require private health insurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Private Health Insurance in Mallorca: A Detailed Comparison</h2>

<h3>Why Private Insurance Is Popular Among Expats</h3>

<p>Approximately 25-30% of Spain''s population holds private health insurance, and the figure is considerably higher among the expat community in Mallorca. Private insurance offers faster access to specialists, English-speaking healthcare professionals, modern private clinics, and the peace of mind that comes with comprehensive coverage. For non-EU citizens applying for a visa or residency permit (such as the non-lucrative visa or digital nomad visa), private health insurance without copayments is typically a mandatory requirement.</p>

<h3>Major Private Insurance Providers Compared</h3>

<p>Here is a detailed comparison of the six major health insurance providers active in Mallorca:</p>

<h4>1. Sanitas</h4>
<p>Sanitas is part of the global Bupa group and is one of the most popular choices among expats in Spain. They have a strong network of English-speaking doctors, a user-friendly app (Blua by Sanitas) for telemedicine, and several clinics in Palma de Mallorca. Sanitas is known for its digital-first approach, offering video consultations, online appointment booking, and digital prescriptions. Their network on the island includes Clinica Rotger (partnered facility) and numerous specialist centres.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excellent digital platform, strong English-language support, wide specialist network, good telemedicine options</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Copago (copayment) plans are cheaper but involve per-visit charges; full coverage plans (<em>cuadro m&eacute;dico completo</em>) cost more but have no copays</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Very high. Sanitas actively markets to the expat community and has English-speaking customer service lines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Asisa</h4>
<p>Asisa is a Spanish cooperative insurer with an extensive network across the Balearic Islands. They own and operate their own hospitals and clinics, which gives them direct quality control. In Mallorca, Asisa operates Hospital Quironsalud Palmaplanas (affiliated) and has a broad network of private practitioners. Asisa is often the most competitively priced option for comprehensive coverage.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Competitive pricing, own hospital network, good coverage for pre-existing conditions after waiting periods, strong presence in Mallorca</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Digital platform not as advanced as Sanitas; English-language support varies by location</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Moderate to high. Some offices have English-speaking staff, though it''s less consistent than Sanitas.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Adeslas (SegurCaixa Adeslas)</h4>
<p>Adeslas is the largest private health insurer in Spain by number of policyholders. Backed by the CaixaBank group, Adeslas has the biggest provider network in the country with over 43,000 affiliated medical professionals and 1,200 medical centres. In Mallorca, they have extensive networks including partnerships with Hospital Juaneda Miramar, Clinica Juaneda, and Hospital de Llevant.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Largest provider network in Spain, diverse plan options from basic to premium, strong financial backing</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Customer service can feel bureaucratic; some plans restrict coverage to specific regions</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Moderate. Large company with standardized processes; English-language support available but not always immediate.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. DKV Seguros</h4>
<p>DKV is part of the German ERGO group (Munich Re) and positions itself as a sustainability-focused insurer. They are well known for their mental health coverage, preventive health programs, and corporate wellness products. DKV has a solid presence in the Balearic Islands with affiliated specialists and clinics.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong mental health and wellness coverage, good preventive care programs, digital health tools, reputable European parent company</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Slightly smaller network in Mallorca compared to Sanitas or Adeslas; may need to travel to Palma for some specialists</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Moderate to high. German-backed company familiar with international clients.</li>
</ul>

<h4>5. Cigna Spain</h4>
<p>Cigna is an American multinational with a growing presence in Spain. They specialize in international health insurance and are popular with digital nomads, corporate employees on assignment, and expats who travel frequently. Cigna offers both local Spanish plans and international plans that provide coverage across multiple countries.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> International coverage options, excellent for expats who travel, English-language processes, strong telemedicine</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Often more expensive than local Spanish providers; local network in Mallorca may be smaller</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Very high. Purpose-built for international clients.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. AXA Spain</h4>
<p>AXA is a French multinational insurance giant with a significant presence in Spain. They offer a range of health insurance products from basic copago plans to comprehensive full-coverage options. AXA is well-established in the Balearic Islands and has a broad provider network.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong global brand, diverse product range, competitive pricing on basic plans, good online portal</li>
  <li><strong>Considerations:</strong> Premium plans can be expensive; network varies by location within Mallorca</li>
  <li><strong>Expat-friendliness:</strong> Moderate. International company with some English-language support.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cost Breakdown by Age Group</h2>

<p>Private health insurance premiums in Spain vary significantly based on age, chosen coverage level, and whether you opt for copago (copayment) or full-coverage (<em>sin copago</em>) plans. Below are approximate monthly premium ranges for comprehensive plans without copayments (which are typically required for visa applications):</p>

<p><strong>Important notes about pricing:</strong> These are indicative ranges based on market data and may vary by provider, specific plan features, and your medical history. Copago plans are cheaper upfront but involve paying &euro;5-30 per visit depending on the type of consultation. For visa applications in Spain, authorities typically require full-coverage plans without copayments. Always request personalized quotes from multiple providers.</p>

<h2>Coverage for Digital Nomads and Remote Workers</h2>

<p>Since Spain introduced its digital nomad visa (Ley de Startups) in 2023, Mallorca has become an increasingly popular base for remote workers from around the world. The digital nomad visa requires applicants to hold private health insurance in Spain, and there are specific considerations for this group:</p>

<h3>Key Requirements for Digital Nomad Visa Insurance</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The insurance must be provided by a company authorized to operate in Spain</li>
  <li>Coverage must be comprehensive and without copayments (<em>sin copago</em>)</li>
  <li>The policy must cover the full duration of your visa</li>
  <li>There should be no exclusions or limitations that would leave gaps in coverage</li>
  <li>International travel insurance or policies from your home country are generally NOT accepted</li>
</ul>

<h3>Best Options for Digital Nomads</h3>
<p>Digital nomads should consider providers that offer flexibility in contract terms, good telemedicine services (essential for remote workers), and ideally some level of international coverage for when you travel. Sanitas and Cigna are particularly popular among digital nomads due to their strong digital platforms, telemedicine options, and English-language support. Asisa is also a solid choice for those seeking the most competitive pricing.</p>

<p>If you''re a digital nomad who splits time between Mallorca and other countries, consider Cigna''s international plans or supplementing a local Spanish policy with travel insurance for periods spent abroad. Remember that most standard Spanish health insurance policies only cover you within Spain.</p>

<h2>Maternity and Fertility Coverage</h2>

<p>For expats planning to start or grow their families in Mallorca, understanding maternity and fertility coverage is essential. There are significant differences between providers:</p>

<h3>Public System Maternity Coverage</h3>
<p>If you''re eligible for public healthcare, maternity care is comprehensive and free, including prenatal checkups, ultrasounds, blood tests, hospital delivery (typically at Son Espases or Son Llatzer in Mallorca), postnatal care, and breastfeeding support. Spain''s public maternity care is of very high quality, though you may have limited choice of hospital and obstetrician.</p>

<h3>Private Insurance Maternity Coverage</h3>
<p>Most private insurers impose a <strong>waiting period of 8-12 months</strong> before maternity benefits activate. This means if you''re already pregnant or planning to conceive within the first year, you may need to rely on the public system for this specific care. Key differences between providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sanitas:</strong> 8-month waiting period. Covers prenatal care, hospital delivery (private room), epidural, C-section, postnatal follow-up. Does not typically cover fertility treatments on standard plans.</li>
  <li><strong>Asisa:</strong> 8-month waiting period. Similar coverage to Sanitas. Some plans include basic fertility support after longer waiting periods.</li>
  <li><strong>Adeslas:</strong> 8-month waiting period on most plans. Comprehensive maternity package including private room, neonatology if needed. Fertility coverage available on premium plans.</li>
  <li><strong>DKV:</strong> 10-month waiting period. Covers standard maternity. Mental health support during and after pregnancy is a strength.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fertility Treatments</h3>
<p>IVF and fertility treatments are available privately in Mallorca with several reputable clinics. Coverage through standard health insurance is limited. The public system covers some fertility treatments with strict criteria (age limits, number of attempts). Private insurance fertility riders or standalone fertility plans are available from some providers but tend to be expensive (adding &euro;50-100+ per month). Many expats choose to self-pay for fertility treatments, with IVF cycles in Mallorca costing approximately &euro;4,000-&euro;7,000 per cycle at private clinics.</p>

<h2>Mental Health Coverage Across Providers</h2>

<p>Mental health support is increasingly important for expats, who may face challenges with cultural adjustment, isolation, and the stress of navigating life in a new country. Coverage varies significantly between providers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Public system:</strong> Covers psychiatry and some psychology through the SNS, but waiting times for mental health specialists in the Balearic Islands can be 2-6 months. Sessions are typically limited in number and conducted in Spanish or Catalan.</li>
  <li><strong>Sanitas:</strong> Offers psychology sessions (typically 15-20 per year on full coverage plans) and psychiatric care. Telemedicine mental health consultations available through their Blua app.</li>
  <li><strong>DKV:</strong> Generally the strongest mental health coverage among Spanish insurers. Offers more psychology sessions per year and has specific wellness and prevention programs.</li>
  <li><strong>Asisa and Adeslas:</strong> Standard psychology and psychiatry coverage. Session limits vary by plan (typically 15-25 per year).</li>
  <li><strong>Cigna:</strong> Good mental health coverage, especially on international plans. 24/7 support lines available in English.</li>
</ul>

<p>If mental health coverage is a priority, ask specifically about the number of psychology sessions included per year, whether telemedicine therapy is available, and whether the provider has English-speaking therapists in their network in Mallorca.</p>

<h2>Dental Insurance Add-Ons</h2>

<p>Dental care is generally NOT included in Spain''s public healthcare system (except for extractions in emergencies and children''s basic dental care). Most private health insurance policies include only basic dental coverage (annual checkup, one cleaning). For comprehensive dental care, you''ll need a dental add-on or standalone dental insurance:</p>

<table style="width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;">

    <tr style="background-color: #f2f2f2;">
      <th style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px; text-align: left;">Coverage Type</th>

      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">Included</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">Annual checkup, basic cleaning, emergency extractions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">Dental add-on</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">&euro;8 - &euro;20</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">Fillings, additional cleanings, X-rays, basic endodontics</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">Comprehensive dental plan</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">&euro;20 - &euro;45</td>
      <td style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 12px;">All of the above plus crowns, bridges, implants (partial coverage), orthodontics (partial)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Sanitas, Adeslas, and Asisa all offer dental add-ons to their health insurance plans. Standalone dental plans from companies like Sanitas Dental or Adeslas Dental can also be purchased independently. Note that implants and orthodontics (braces, Invisalign) typically receive only partial coverage (30-50% discount) even on comprehensive dental plans.</p>

<h2>Pre-Existing Condition Policies</h2>

<p>Understanding how Spanish insurers handle pre-existing conditions is crucial for many expats. Here''s what you need to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Declaration requirement:</strong> All Spanish insurers require you to complete a health questionnaire (<em>cuestionario de salud</em>) when applying. You must honestly declare all pre-existing conditions, ongoing treatments, and relevant medical history. Failure to declare can result in claim denials or policy cancellation.</li>
  <li><strong>Waiting periods:</strong> Most conditions are subject to waiting periods, typically 3-6 months for minor conditions and 8-12 months for more significant ones. During this period, treatment related to the pre-existing condition will not be covered.</li>
  <li><strong>Exclusions:</strong> Some conditions may be permanently excluded from coverage, especially if they require expensive ongoing treatment. The insurer will specify any exclusions in writing before you sign the contract.</li>
  <li><strong>Surcharges:</strong> In some cases, the insurer may offer coverage for a pre-existing condition but at an additional premium surcharge.</li>
  <li><strong>Guaranteed renewal:</strong> Once accepted, Spanish health insurers generally cannot cancel your policy or exclude conditions that develop after you''ve been insured. This is an important consumer protection under Spanish insurance law.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Asisa is often considered the most flexible provider regarding pre-existing conditions, while Sanitas and Adeslas may be stricter in their underwriting. If you have significant pre-existing conditions, work with an insurance broker who can negotiate with multiple providers on your behalf.</p>

<h2>How to File a Claim in Spain: Step by Step</h2>

<p>Filing a health insurance claim in Spain depends on whether you use providers within your insurer''s network (<em>cuadro m&eacute;dico</em>) or seek care outside the network:</p>

<h3>In-Network Care (Most Common)</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Find a provider:</strong> Use your insurer''s app or website to find an in-network doctor, specialist, or clinic. Most insurers have search tools filtered by location, specialty, and language.</li>
  <li><strong>Book an appointment:</strong> Call the provider directly, use the insurer''s app, or call the insurer''s appointment booking line. Many insurers now offer online booking.</li>
  <li><strong>Attend your appointment:</strong> Present your insurance card and ID at the clinic. For copago plans, you''ll pay the copayment at the time of service. For full-coverage plans, there is usually nothing to pay.</li>
  <li><strong>Authorization for procedures:</strong> Some treatments, surgeries, and diagnostic tests require prior authorization (<em>autorizaci&oacute;n previa</em>) from the insurer. Your doctor will typically handle this, but it may take 24-72 hours for approval.</li>
  <li><strong>No claim filing needed:</strong> For in-network care, the provider bills the insurer directly. You don''t need to file a claim or submit receipts.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Out-of-Network or Reimbursement Claims</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Pay upfront:</strong> Pay the full cost of the medical service at the time of treatment.</li>
  <li><strong>Collect documentation:</strong> Obtain an official invoice (<em>factura</em>) with the provider''s tax ID (NIF/CIF), a detailed description of the services received, and any medical reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Submit the claim:</strong> Most insurers allow claims submission through their app or online portal. You can also submit by email or post. Include the invoice, medical reports, and your policy details.</li>
  <li><strong>Wait for processing:</strong> Reimbursement typically takes 2-6 weeks. The amount reimbursed depends on your policy terms and may not cover 100% of out-of-network charges.</li>
  <li><strong>Follow up if needed:</strong> If you haven''t received reimbursement within the expected timeframe, contact customer service with your claim reference number.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Emergency Situations</h3>
<p>In a genuine emergency, go directly to the nearest hospital emergency department (<em>urgencias</em>), whether public or private. All insurers cover emergency care, and you should not delay treatment to check network status. Contact your insurer within 24-72 hours of an emergency admission to register the claim.</p>

<h2>Decision Flowchart: Which Insurance Do You Need?</h2>

<p>Your ideal health insurance setup in Mallorca depends on your specific situation. Here''s a practical guide based on residency type:</p>

<h3>EU Citizen Working in Spain (Employed)</h3>
<p>You''re covered by the public system through your social security contributions. Consider adding private insurance (&euro;50-120/month) for faster access and English-speaking doctors. Your employer may offer group private insurance as a benefit.</p>

<h3>EU Citizen Working in Spain (Aut&oacute;nomo/Self-Employed)</h3>
<p>You''re covered by the public system through your aut&oacute;nomo social security contributions. Private insurance is optional but popular. Many aut&oacute;nomos choose a basic copago plan to supplement the public system.</p>

<h3>EU Citizen - Retiree</h3>
<p>Apply for an S1 form from your home country for full public healthcare access. Many retirees add a basic private plan for convenience. See our <a href="/blog/health-insurance-over-65-mallorca">health insurance for over 65s in Mallorca guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Non-EU Citizen on Non-Lucrative Visa</h3>
<p>Private health insurance without copayments is mandatory for your visa application. You cannot rely on the public system. Budget &euro;80-200/month depending on age. After one year of residency, you may become eligible for the public system through <em>convenio especial</em>.</p>

<h3>Digital Nomad Visa Holder</h3>
<p>Private health insurance from a Spanish-authorized company is mandatory. Must be comprehensive and without copayments. Budget &euro;70-150/month. Sanitas and Cigna are popular choices.</p>

<h3>Non-EU Retiree</h3>
<p>Private insurance is typically required for residency. No reciprocal healthcare agreements (for most non-EU countries). Consider international insurers (Cigna Global, Bupa Global) or Spanish providers accepting seniors. Budget &euro;200-500+/month depending on age and health.</p>

<h3>UK Citizen (Post-Brexit)</h3>
<p>If you were registered as a resident in Spain before December 31, 2020, you retain healthcare rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. New arrivals must obtain private insurance for residency applications, similar to other non-EU citizens. UK GHIC provides emergency coverage during short visits. UK retirees may still be eligible for S1 form coverage.</p>

<h2>Insurance for Visitors and Tourists</h2>

<p>If you''re visiting Mallorca rather than residing here, your insurance options differ:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>EHIC/GHIC (European Health Insurance Card / Global Health Insurance Card):</strong> EU/EEA citizens and UK citizens should carry this card, which provides access to emergency and medically necessary treatment at public healthcare facilities on the same terms as Spanish residents. It does NOT cover private healthcare, repatriation, or non-emergency treatment.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> All visitors should consider travel insurance that includes medical coverage, emergency repatriation, and medical evacuation. This is especially important for non-EU visitors who don''t have EHIC rights. Look for policies covering at least &euro;100,000 in medical expenses.</li>
  <li><strong>Credit card travel insurance:</strong> Some premium credit cards include travel insurance as a benefit. Check the terms carefully, as coverage limits, exclusions, and claim processes vary widely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Switching Between Insurance Providers</h2>

<p>If you''re unhappy with your current insurer or find a better deal, switching is straightforward in Spain:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h3>Do I need health insurance to get residency in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>It depends on your residency type and nationality. Non-EU citizens applying for visas such as the non-lucrative visa, digital nomad visa, or student visa must show proof of comprehensive private health insurance without copayments as part of their application. EU citizens can rely on their EHIC temporarily or demonstrate they will be covered through employment. Retirees from EU countries can use their S1 form. In practice, having health insurance is essential for all residents, even if it''s not a formal requirement for your specific residency category.</p>

<h3>How much does health insurance cost in Mallorca per month?</h3>
<p>Monthly costs for private health insurance in Mallorca range from approximately &euro;35-55 for a basic copago plan for someone in their 20s, up to &euro;300-600+ for comprehensive full-coverage plans for those over 65. The average expat in their 30s-40s typically pays &euro;80-150 per month for a comprehensive plan without copayments. Factors affecting price include your age, chosen provider, coverage level (copago vs. full coverage), and any add-ons like dental or maternity coverage. Always request quotes from multiple providers to compare.</p>

<h3>Can I use my European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Yes, if you hold a valid EHIC (or UK GHIC), you can access medically necessary treatment at public healthcare facilities in Mallorca on the same terms as Spanish nationals. This covers emergency treatment, necessary ongoing treatment for pre-existing conditions, and routine maternity care during a temporary stay. However, the EHIC does not cover private healthcare, non-emergency treatment if you are a resident, dental care (beyond emergencies), repatriation, or medical evacuation. It is designed for temporary stays, not for residents. If you''re moving to Mallorca permanently, you''ll need to arrange proper resident coverage.</p>

<h3>What does private health insurance typically NOT cover in Spain?</h3>
<p>Even comprehensive private health insurance in Spain typically excludes or limits certain types of care. Common exclusions include: cosmetic and elective surgery (procedures not deemed medically necessary), experimental treatments and clinical trials, self-inflicted injuries, injuries from extreme sports (unless a rider is added), pre-existing conditions during waiting periods, fertility treatments (unless specifically included), most dental implants and orthodontics (unless a dental rider is added), long-term nursing home care, and treatment related to substance abuse. Always read the policy exclusions carefully before signing, and ask your broker about any specific treatments or conditions you''re concerned about.</p>

<h3>Is there an age limit for getting private health insurance in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Yes, most Spanish private health insurers impose maximum entry ages. Sanitas typically accepts new clients up to age 69-70. Asisa has a maximum entry age of around 65-69 depending on the plan. Adeslas generally accepts new clients up to age 65. DKV has varying limits, usually around 65-70. If you''re over 65, options become more limited and expensive. International health insurers like Cigna Global, Bupa Global, and Allianz Care may accept older applicants but at significantly higher premiums. See our detailed <a href="/blog/health-insurance-over-65-mallorca">guide to health insurance for over 65s in Mallorca</a> for specific guidance.</p>

<h3>Can I get health insurance in Mallorca if I have pre-existing conditions?</h3>
<p>Yes, but with certain limitations. Spanish insurers require you to declare all pre-existing conditions on a health questionnaire. Depending on the severity and cost of the condition, the insurer may: accept you with standard waiting periods (3-12 months during which the condition is not covered), accept you with the condition permanently excluded, accept you with a premium surcharge, or in rare cases decline the application. Asisa is generally considered the most flexible provider for pre-existing conditions. Working with an experienced insurance broker who can submit your application to multiple providers simultaneously is highly recommended if you have significant pre-existing conditions.</p>

<h3>How do I access emergency healthcare in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>In a medical emergency in Mallorca, call 112 (the pan-European emergency number) for an ambulance. You can go directly to the emergency department (<em>urgencias</em>) of any hospital. The main public hospitals with 24/7 emergency departments are Hospital Universitari Son Espases and Hospital Son Llatzer in Palma, Hospital de Manacor in the east, and Hospital Comarcal d''Inca in the north. Private hospitals with emergency departments include Clinica Rotger, Hospital Juaneda Miramar, and Clinica Juaneda. If you have private insurance, you can go to either public or private emergency rooms. Notify your insurer within 24-72 hours of any emergency admission. Emergency care will always be provided regardless of your insurance status.</p>

<h3>Should I use a broker or buy health insurance directly in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Both options are valid, and the best choice depends on your situation. Using an insurance broker is recommended if you have pre-existing conditions (brokers can negotiate with multiple providers), if you''re new to the Spanish insurance market and want guidance, if you don''t speak Spanish, or if you want to compare multiple quotes without contacting each insurer individually. Brokers in Spain are typically paid by commission from the insurer, so their service is free to you and does not increase your premium. Buying directly is fine if you know exactly what you want, have no pre-existing conditions, and are comfortable navigating the application process. Many insurers like Sanitas have dedicated English-speaking sales teams for direct purchases.</p>

<h3>Does my Spanish health insurance cover me when traveling outside Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Most standard Spanish private health insurance policies cover you throughout Spain, not just in Mallorca. However, coverage outside of Spain is generally limited to emergencies during temporary travel (typically up to 30-90 days, depending on the policy). If you travel frequently outside Spain, consider supplementing your Spanish policy with travel insurance, or choose an international health insurance plan from providers like Cigna or Bupa that provides broader geographic coverage. If you have public healthcare (SNS), you can request a European Health Insurance Card (TSE in Spanish) that covers you for necessary treatment in other EU/EEA countries during temporary stays.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between copago and full coverage (sin copago) health insurance in Spain?</h3>
<p>Copago plans have lower monthly premiums but require you to pay a small fee (copayment) each time you use a medical service. Typical copayments range from &euro;3-5 for a GP visit, &euro;5-15 for a specialist, &euro;10-20 for diagnostic tests, and &euro;50-150 for hospital admission. Full coverage plans (<em>sin copago</em> or <em>cuadro m&eacute;dico completo</em>) have higher monthly premiums but no additional charges when you access care. For visa applications in Spain, authorities typically require full-coverage plans without copayments. If you use medical services frequently, a full-coverage plan may be more economical despite the higher monthly cost. If you rarely see doctors and mainly want coverage for emergencies, a copago plan can save money.</p>
