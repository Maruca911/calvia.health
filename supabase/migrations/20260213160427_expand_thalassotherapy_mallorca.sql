<h2>What Is Thalassotherapy? Definition and Origins</h2>

<p>Thalassotherapy is a therapeutic practice that uses seawater, marine algae, sea mud, sand, and other ocean-derived substances for health and wellness purposes. The word itself derives from the ancient Greek "thalassa" (θάλασσα), meaning "sea," and "therapeia" (θεραπεία), meaning "treatment" or "healing." In its modern clinical definition, thalassotherapy encompasses any therapeutic use of the marine environment, including the seawater itself, the marine climate (sea air, sunlight, and temperature), and biological marine products.</p>

<p>The concept of using seawater for healing is far older than the word itself. Ancient Greek physicians, including Hippocrates (circa 460–370 BCE), documented the use of seawater baths for treating skin conditions, wounds, and joint pain. Hippocrates observed that fishermen''s hands, despite constant exposure to physical trauma, healed remarkably quickly — a phenomenon he attributed to the antiseptic and mineralizing properties of seawater. The Roman physician Galen (circa 129–216 CE) also prescribed sea bathing for various ailments, and Roman bathhouses frequently incorporated saltwater pools alongside their famous freshwater thermal baths.</p>

<p>However, the formal development of thalassotherapy as a structured therapeutic discipline did not occur until the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1750, the English physician Dr. Richard Russell published a seminal work, "A Dissertation on the Use of Sea Water in the Diseases of the Glands," which advocated systematic sea bathing and seawater ingestion for conditions ranging from scurvy to depression. This work sparked the development of seaside health resorts across Britain and continental Europe.</p>

<p>France became the true birthplace of modern thalassotherapy. In 1869, Dr. Joseph de la Bonnardière coined the term "thalassothérapie," and in 1899, Dr. Louis Bagot established the first formal thalassotherapy centre in Roscoff, Brittany. France remains the world leader in thalassotherapy, with over 50 accredited centres, strict regulatory standards, and thalassotherapy treatments partially covered by the French social security system for certain medical conditions. Spain, Italy, Tunisia, and Greece have also developed significant thalassotherapy industries, and the practice has spread to destinations worldwide.</p>

<h2>The History of Seawater Healing in the Balearic Islands</h2>

<p>The Balearic Islands — Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, and Formentera — occupy a unique position in the history of Mediterranean seawater healing. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Talaiotic people who inhabited Mallorca from approximately 1300 BCE used coastal caves and natural rock pools for ritual bathing and, possibly, therapeutic purposes. Roman settlers later established bath complexes on the island, some incorporating seawater.</p>

<p>During the Moorish period (903–1229 CE), the tradition of hammam bathing flourished in Mallorca. While hammams traditionally use freshwater, the Moorish bathhouses in Palma and other coastal settlements are believed to have occasionally incorporated seawater, given their proximity to the shore and the Islamic medical tradition''s recognition of salt water''s healing properties. The famous Arab baths in Palma (Banys Àrabs), dating from the 10th century, remain one of Mallorca''s most visited historical sites and a testament to the island''s long bathing culture.</p>

<p>The modern thalassotherapy movement reached Mallorca in the late 20th century, as the island''s tourism industry matured from mass sun-and-beach holidays toward more diversified wellness and luxury offerings. The opening of dedicated thalassotherapy facilities, most notably the Elba Sunset Mallorca Thalasso Spa in Palmanova, brought authentic, French-standard thalassotherapy to the island for the first time. Today, Mallorca is recognized as one of the premier thalassotherapy destinations in the western Mediterranean, combining genuine therapeutic seawater facilities with the island''s natural advantages of a mild climate, clean coastal waters, and well-developed wellness infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Clinical Evidence for Thalassotherapy</h2>

<p>While thalassotherapy has a long empirical history, modern clinical research has begun to provide scientific evidence supporting many of its traditional claims. Below is a summary of key areas where peer-reviewed studies have investigated thalassotherapy''s therapeutic effects. It is important to note that while results are promising, the overall body of evidence is still growing, and thalassotherapy should be considered a complementary therapy, not a replacement for conventional medical treatment.</p>

<h3>Arthritis and Rheumatic Conditions</h3>
<p>Several randomized controlled trials have examined thalassotherapy for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. A landmark study by Falagas et al. (2009), published in the <em>International Journal of Clinical Practice</em>, reviewed evidence from multiple trials and concluded that balneotherapy and thalassotherapy were associated with statistically significant improvements in pain, function, and quality of life for arthritis patients compared to control groups. A Spanish study by Morer et al. (2017) specifically examined the mineral content of Mediterranean seawater and its relevance to rheumatic conditions, noting that the high magnesium and bromide content may contribute to anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

<h3>Psoriasis and Skin Conditions</h3>
<p>The Dead Sea, with its extreme mineral concentration, has been the most extensively studied site for the treatment of psoriasis through saltwater immersion and sun exposure (climatotherapy). However, Mediterranean thalassotherapy has also shown benefits. A study by Kazandjieva et al. (2008) found that a combination of seawater baths and controlled UV exposure led to significant improvement in psoriasis severity scores. The minerals in seawater — particularly magnesium, bromide, and strontium — appear to have anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects on skin cells, helping to reduce the excessive cell turnover that characterizes psoriasis.</p>

<h3>Fibromyalgia</h3>
<p>Fibromyalgia, a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties, is notoriously difficult to treat. A randomized controlled trial published in <em>Rheumatology International</em> (Zijlstra et al., 2007) found that a two-week thalassotherapy programme produced significant improvements in pain, fatigue, and overall wellbeing that persisted for up to six months after treatment. The combination of warm seawater immersion, gentle exercise in the buoyant water, and the overall relaxation of the spa environment appears to address multiple aspects of the condition simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Respiratory Conditions</h3>
<p>Aerosolized seawater (inhaling fine seawater mist) has been used in thalassotherapy centres for respiratory conditions including chronic bronchitis, sinusitis, and allergic rhinitis. The natural saline solution helps to thin mucus, reduce inflammation in the airways, and clear allergens and irritants. This is the same principle behind medical saline nebulizer treatments and nasal irrigation with saline solution, but thalassotherapy applies it in a more immersive, holistic context. A study in the <em>European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology</em> found that thermal seawater nasal irrigation significantly improved nasal symptoms and quality of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis.</p>

<h3>Chronic Pain</h3>
<p>The analgesic (pain-relieving) effects of warm seawater immersion are supported by several mechanisms: the buoyancy of salt water reduces gravitational stress on joints and the spine; the warmth increases blood flow and promotes muscle relaxation; and the hydrostatic pressure of water immersion may activate pain-gating mechanisms. A systematic review by Bender et al. (2014) in the <em>European Journal of Integrative Medicine</em> found moderate evidence supporting hydrotherapy and thalassotherapy for chronic lower back pain, with improvements in pain intensity, functional disability, and return-to-work rates.</p>

<h2>How Thalassotherapy Works: Minerals in Mediterranean Seawater</h2>

<p>The therapeutic properties of thalassotherapy are largely attributed to the mineral composition of seawater and its interaction with the human body. Mediterranean seawater contains over 80 trace elements, with the following major minerals being of particular therapeutic relevance:</p>

<h3>Magnesium</h3>
<p>Mediterranean seawater contains approximately 1,290 mg/L of magnesium. Magnesium is essential for muscle relaxation, nerve function, and over 300 enzymatic reactions in the body. Transdermal absorption of magnesium through the skin during seawater immersion is supported by research, though the extent of absorption varies by individual. Magnesium deficiency is common in modern populations and has been linked to muscle cramps, insomnia, anxiety, and migraines. Regular thalassotherapy may help supplement dietary magnesium intake through skin absorption.</p>

<h3>Calcium</h3>
<p>At approximately 412 mg/L, calcium in seawater supports bone health, muscle contraction, and cellular signaling. While the primary route for calcium intake is dietary, the presence of dissolved calcium in seawater contributes to the overall mineralizing effect of thalassotherapy treatments and may benefit skin health by supporting the skin''s barrier function.</p>

<h3>Potassium</h3>
<p>Potassium (approximately 399 mg/L) is critical for heart function, muscle contraction, and fluid balance. The potassium in seawater helps to maintain the osmotic balance of skin cells during immersion and may contribute to the skin-softening effect commonly reported after seawater baths.</p>

<h3>Iodine</h3>
<p>Iodine is essential for thyroid function, which regulates metabolism, energy production, and body temperature. The coastal environment naturally provides iodine through both seawater contact and inhalation of sea air, which contains iodine-rich aerosols. This is one reason why thalassotherapy traditionally emphasizes the importance of the marine climate as a whole, not just seawater immersion. Thalassotherapy centres in Mallorca benefit from their beachfront locations, where guests naturally inhale iodine-enriched air.</p>

<h3>Sodium and Chloride</h3>
<p>The primary salt in seawater, sodium chloride, creates the osmotic conditions that facilitate mineral absorption through the skin and have natural antiseptic properties. The salt concentration of seawater (approximately 35 g/L in the Mediterranean) also creates buoyancy, reducing the effective body weight by approximately 90% during immersion and allowing gentle, low-impact movement that is particularly beneficial for those with joint conditions or limited mobility.</p>

<h3>Trace Elements</h3>
<p>Beyond the major minerals, seawater contains trace elements including zinc (skin healing and immune function), selenium (antioxidant protection), manganese (connective tissue health), and bromide (calming effect on the nervous system). While present in small quantities, these trace elements contribute to the overall therapeutic profile of seawater and are one reason why thalassotherapy practitioners maintain that real seawater cannot be replicated by simply dissolving sea salt in tap water.</p>

<h2>Types of Thalassotherapy Treatments</h2>

<p>Modern thalassotherapy centres offer a diverse range of treatments, all centred around the therapeutic use of seawater and marine products. Here are the main treatment types you will encounter in Mallorca.</p>

<h3>Heated Seawater Pools</h3>
<p>The foundation of any thalassotherapy centre is its heated seawater pool. Mediterranean seawater is pumped from the open sea (ideally from a depth of several metres and at a distance from the shore to ensure purity), filtered to remove particulates while retaining its mineral content, and heated to a therapeutic temperature of 33–36°C. Pools typically feature hydromassage jets at various heights and pressures, targeting the back, legs, shoulders, and feet. Some facilities include counter-current swimming channels for gentle aquatic exercise.</p>

<h3>Jet Showers and Affusion Treatments</h3>
<p>Jet showers (also called "douche à affusion" in French thalassotherapy terminology) use pressurized seawater streams directed at the body by a therapist. The pressure and temperature can be varied to create stimulating or relaxing effects. High-pressure jets are used to address cellulite, improve circulation, and energize, while gentler affusion (where warm seawater is poured over the body on a treatment table) promotes deep relaxation and enhances mineral absorption.</p>

<h3>Algae and Seaweed Wraps</h3>
<p>Marine algae are rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and antioxidants. In thalassotherapy, algae are typically applied to the body as a warm paste, then the body is wrapped in thermal blankets to enhance absorption over 20–40 minutes. Different types of algae are used for different purposes: fucus (bladderwrack) for metabolism stimulation, laminaria for mineral replenishment, spirulina for antioxidant protection, and lithothamnium for calcium enrichment. The warmth and mineral content of the algae wraps produce a deeply nourishing effect on the skin and muscles.</p>

<h3>Seaweed Baths</h3>
<p>Seaweed baths involve immersion in a bathtub filled with heated seawater and fresh or reconstituted seaweed. As the seaweed releases its nutrients into the warm water, the body absorbs minerals and trace elements through the skin. The gelatinous texture of the seaweed also creates a gentle, enveloping sensation that many clients find deeply relaxing. Seaweed baths are traditionally recommended for joint stiffness, skin dryness, and general fatigue.</p>

<h3>Marine Mud Treatments</h3>
<p>Marine mud (also called sea silt or marine sediment) is harvested from specific coastal areas where mineral-rich sediment has accumulated over centuries. The mud is warmed and applied to the body or specific areas (such as joints or the back), where its high mineral content — particularly sulfur, magnesium, and calcium — is absorbed through the skin. Marine mud treatments are particularly popular for arthritis, muscle stiffness, and skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The thermal properties of mud allow it to retain heat longer than water, providing sustained warmth to the treated area.</p>

<h3>Sea Salt Scrubs</h3>
<p>Exfoliation with sea salt crystals, often blended with essential oils or marine extracts, removes dead skin cells, stimulates circulation, and prepares the skin for subsequent treatments. Sea salt scrubs are typically performed before body wraps or immersion treatments to maximize mineral absorption. The scrubs leave the skin feeling remarkably smooth and refreshed, and the mechanical stimulation promotes lymphatic drainage.</p>

<h3>Aerosolization (Marine Aerosol Therapy)</h3>
<p>Aerosolization involves inhaling a fine mist of seawater particles, typically produced by specialized nebulizer equipment or natural wave action. The microscopic seawater droplets reach deep into the respiratory tract, providing natural saline irrigation to the airways. This treatment is used for chronic sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, and general respiratory wellness. Some thalassotherapy centres have dedicated aerosol rooms where clients breathe the seawater mist in a relaxing, climate-controlled environment.</p>

<h2>Thalassotherapy Centres in Mallorca</h2>

<h3>Elba Sunset Mallorca Thalasso Spa — Palmanova</h3>
<p>The Elba Sunset Mallorca Thalasso Spa in Palmanova is the premier thalassotherapy facility on the island and one of the most respected in Spain. Occupying 3,000 square metres, the centre pumps heated Mediterranean seawater directly into its treatment pools, adhering to strict thalassotherapy protocols. The facility includes a large thalasso circuit with multiple seawater pools at varying temperatures, hydromassage stations, a flotation pool, counter-current walking channels, bubble beds, Finnish sauna, steam room, ice fountain, and sensory showers.</p>

<p>The treatment menu is extensive and specifically designed around thalassotherapy principles. Popular options include the Thalasso Algae Wrap (50 minutes, approximately €80–€100), Marine Mud Joint Treatment (45 minutes, approximately €75–€90), Pressurized Seawater Jet Massage (30 minutes, approximately €55–€70), and the comprehensive "Full Thalasso Day" programme (approximately €180–€250), which includes thalasso circuit access, two treatments, and a healthy lunch.</p>

<p>Multi-day thalassotherapy programmes are available and recommended for those seeking therapeutic benefits for chronic conditions. A typical 5-day programme includes daily circuit access, a combination of body treatments (alternating between algae wraps, mud treatments, and jet therapy), and a nutritional consultation. Prices for multi-day programmes typically range from €500–€900 depending on the treatments selected.</p>

<h3>Other Thalassotherapy-Adjacent Options in Mallorca</h3>
<p>While the Elba Sunset is the only fully dedicated thalassotherapy centre on the island, several other Mallorcan spas incorporate seawater or marine-derived products into their treatment menus. These include hotel spas that offer marine algae wraps, sea salt scrubs, and seaweed baths using products derived from Mediterranean marine sources, even if their pools use treated freshwater rather than pumped seawater. For those staying in other parts of the island, these options provide a taste of marine-based therapy without the full thalassotherapy circuit experience.</p>

<p>Natural sea bathing — simply swimming in Mallorca''s crystal-clear coastal waters — also provides many of the benefits associated with thalassotherapy, albeit in an uncontrolled environment. The Mediterranean Sea around Mallorca is renowned for its cleanliness and clarity, and regular sea swimming is a cherished local tradition with a growing body of evidence supporting its health benefits.</p>

<h2>Comparison with Other Hydrotherapy Methods</h2>

<p>Understanding how thalassotherapy relates to other water-based therapies can help you choose the most appropriate treatment for your needs.</p>

<h3>Thalassotherapy vs. Balneotherapy</h3>
<p>Balneotherapy uses naturally mineralized water from thermal springs (mineral water, not seawater) for therapeutic purposes. The mineral composition of thermal spring water varies by location and may include sulfur, iron, lithium, radon, and other elements not found in significant concentrations in seawater. Balneotherapy is more commonly associated with inland European spa towns (such as Budapest, Bath, or Baden-Baden), while thalassotherapy is inherently coastal. Both have evidence supporting their use for rheumatic conditions, but the specific mineral profiles differ, and each may be better suited to particular conditions.</p>

<h3>Thalassotherapy vs. Thermal Spa</h3>
<p>Thermal spas use geothermally heated water, which may or may not be mineralized. The primary therapeutic element is the temperature of the water rather than its mineral content. While thalassotherapy and thermal spa treatments overlap in their use of warm water immersion, thalassotherapy specifically relies on the mineral composition of seawater and the broader marine environment (sea air, marine products) as integral parts of the therapy.</p>

<h3>Thalassotherapy vs. Freshwater Hydrotherapy</h3>
<p>Conventional hydrotherapy (as used in physiotherapy and rehabilitation) uses treated freshwater and relies primarily on the physical properties of water — buoyancy, hydrostatic pressure, and temperature — for therapeutic benefit. Thalassotherapy adds the chemical dimension of seawater''s mineral content, the biological dimension of marine-derived products (algae, mud), and the environmental dimension of the marine climate.</p>

<h2>Conditions That May Benefit from Thalassotherapy</h2>

<p>Based on the available clinical evidence and traditional therapeutic applications, thalassotherapy may provide complementary benefits for the following conditions. <strong>Important: These are not medical recommendations. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before using thalassotherapy for any medical condition.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> Warm seawater immersion and marine mud applications may reduce pain and improve joint function.</li>
  <li><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong> Anti-inflammatory effects of magnesium and bromide in seawater may complement pharmaceutical treatment.</li>
  <li><strong>Fibromyalgia:</strong> Multi-day programmes combining warm water therapy, gentle exercise, and relaxation may reduce widespread pain and fatigue.</li>
  <li><strong>Psoriasis:</strong> Seawater minerals may reduce skin inflammation and excessive cell proliferation when combined with controlled UV exposure.</li>
  <li><strong>Eczema and atopic dermatitis:</strong> Mineral-rich seawater may help restore the skin barrier and reduce itching, though individual responses vary significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Chronic lower back pain:</strong> Buoyancy-assisted exercise and hydromassage in warm seawater may reduce pain and improve functional mobility.</li>
  <li><strong>Chronic sinusitis and rhinitis:</strong> Aerosolized seawater and nasal irrigation with marine saline solutions may reduce nasal congestion and inflammation.</li>
  <li><strong>Chronic stress and burnout:</strong> The overall thalassotherapy environment — warmth, buoyancy, mineral immersion, marine air, and structured relaxation — activates the parasympathetic nervous system and may reduce cortisol levels.</li>
  <li><strong>Post-surgical recovery:</strong> Gentle aquatic therapy in warm seawater may support rehabilitation after orthopaedic surgery, with the buoyancy allowing earlier mobilization. (Requires surgeon approval.)</li>
  <li><strong>Peripheral circulation issues:</strong> Counter-current walking in seawater pools and contrast temperature therapy may improve circulation in the lower limbs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Contraindications: When to Avoid Thalassotherapy</h2>

<p>Thalassotherapy is not suitable for everyone. The following conditions are generally considered contraindications, meaning that thalassotherapy should be avoided or undertaken only with explicit medical approval:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Acute cardiovascular conditions:</strong> Unstable angina, recent heart attack, uncontrolled hypertension, or severe heart failure. The combination of warm water immersion and hydrostatic pressure can place significant demands on the cardiovascular system.</li>
  <li><strong>Open wounds or active infections:</strong> Immersion in communal seawater pools with open wounds presents both an infection risk to the individual and a contamination risk to other users.</li>
  <li><strong>Acute febrile illness:</strong> Any condition involving fever, as warm water immersion can further elevate body temperature.</li>
  <li><strong>Severe epilepsy:</strong> The risk of seizure during water immersion requires careful medical assessment.</li>
  <li><strong>Active cancer treatment:</strong> Unless specifically recommended by the treating oncologist, as some treatments may be contraindicated during chemotherapy or radiotherapy.</li>
  <li><strong>Pregnancy:</strong> While gentle seawater immersion at moderate temperatures may be safe, the heated pools (above 37°C), saunas, and steam rooms typical of thalassotherapy circuits are generally not recommended during pregnancy. Pregnant women should consult their obstetrician and inform the thalassotherapy centre before any treatment.</li>
  <li><strong>Severe varicose veins or deep vein thrombosis:</strong> Hot water immersion may worsen these conditions. Medical clearance is essential.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperthyroidism:</strong> The iodine content of seawater and the marine environment may exacerbate thyroid overactivity. Consult an endocrinologist before thalassotherapy.</li>
  <li><strong>Allergy to iodine or marine products:</strong> Those with known marine allergies should exercise caution with algae wraps, seaweed baths, and marine mud treatments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Home Thalassotherapy Tips</h2>

<p>While a professional thalassotherapy centre provides the most authentic and effective experience, there are ways to incorporate elements of marine therapy into your home wellness routine.</p>

<h3>Sea Salt Baths</h3>
<p>Adding high-quality, unrefined sea salt (not table salt, which has been stripped of trace minerals) to a warm bath can approximate some of the mineral benefits of seawater immersion. Use approximately 500g–1kg of sea salt per full bath and soak for 20–30 minutes. Mediterranean sea salt, Dead Sea salt, or Celtic sea salt are all good options. The mineral content is lower than genuine seawater, but many people report improvements in skin condition, muscle relaxation, and sleep quality with regular sea salt baths.</p>

<h3>Seaweed Products</h3>
<p>Dried seaweed products for bath use are available from health food stores and online retailers. Bladder wrack (Fucus vesiculosus) and kelp are commonly available and can be added to bath water in mesh bags or used as body wraps by soaking the seaweed in warm water and applying it to the skin. Commercial seaweed body masks and scrubs are also widely available and provide concentrated marine minerals for skin application.</p>

<h3>Breathing Sea Air</h3>
<p>If you live near or are visiting the Mallorcan coast, simply spending time walking along the shoreline provides exposure to the iodine-rich, mineral-laden sea air that forms part of the traditional thalassotherapy environment. The World Health Organization recognizes coastal air quality as a factor in respiratory health, and studies have shown that people living near the coast report better mental and physical health outcomes than those living inland, after controlling for other factors.</p>

<h3>Marine-Based Skincare</h3>
<p>Numerous skincare brands now offer products formulated with marine ingredients such as seaweed extracts, marine collagen, sea mineral complexes, and thermal seawater. While these products cannot replicate the full thalassotherapy experience, they can provide targeted marine mineral benefits for the skin as part of a daily skincare routine.</p>

<h2>Costs and Access</h2>

<p>Thalassotherapy in Mallorca is accessible across a range of budgets, depending on the type and duration of treatment chosen.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thalasso circuit access (90 minutes):</strong> Approximately €35–€55 per person at the Elba Sunset.</li>
  <li><strong>Individual thalassotherapy treatment (45–60 minutes):</strong> Approximately €75–€110, depending on the specific treatment.</li>
  <li><strong>Half-day thalasso programme (circuit + treatment + relaxation):</strong> Approximately €120–€160.</li>
  <li><strong>Full-day thalasso programme (circuit + two treatments + healthy lunch):</strong> Approximately €180–€250.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-day programme (5 days, daily circuit + treatments):</strong> Approximately €500–€900.</li>
  <li><strong>Free option — sea swimming:</strong> The Mediterranean Sea itself is the ultimate thalassotherapy resource and is free for everyone. Mallorca''s Blue Flag beaches provide clean, mineral-rich seawater for natural immersion.</li>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Is thalassotherapy scientifically proven to work?</h3>
<p>Thalassotherapy has a growing body of clinical evidence supporting its use for several conditions, particularly arthritis, chronic pain, psoriasis, and respiratory issues. Multiple randomized controlled trials have found statistically significant improvements compared to control groups. However, the overall evidence base is smaller than for mainstream medical treatments, and many studies have methodological limitations (such as difficulty blinding participants). The scientific consensus is that thalassotherapy can be a valuable complementary therapy when used alongside conventional medical treatment, but it should not be relied upon as a sole treatment for serious medical conditions.</p>

<h3>How is thalassotherapy different from just swimming in the sea?</h3>
<p>While sea swimming provides many of the same mineral-exposure benefits as thalassotherapy, clinical thalassotherapy differs in several important ways. First, the seawater in thalassotherapy centres is heated to specific therapeutic temperatures (typically 33–36°C), which promotes vasodilation, muscle relaxation, and mineral absorption far more effectively than cold sea swimming. Second, the seawater is filtered to remove biological contaminants while retaining minerals. Third, treatments are administered under professional supervision using specific protocols, durations, and complementary therapies (algae wraps, mud treatments, jet massage) designed to maximize therapeutic outcomes. Finally, the controlled environment allows treatment year-round, regardless of weather or sea conditions.</p>

<h3>How many thalassotherapy sessions do I need to see results?</h3>
<p>For general relaxation and wellness, even a single session can produce noticeable benefits — reduced muscle tension, improved skin condition, and a sense of deep relaxation. For therapeutic purposes (managing a chronic condition), most thalassotherapy practitioners recommend a minimum of 3–5 consecutive days of treatment for initial results, with periodic "maintenance" sessions thereafter. Clinical studies that demonstrated significant benefits for conditions like arthritis and fibromyalgia typically used treatment programmes lasting 1–3 weeks. Many people who discover thalassotherapy incorporate it as a regular part of their wellness routine, returning for periodic courses throughout the year.</p>

<h3>Can children undergo thalassotherapy?</h3>
<p>Some thalassotherapy treatments are suitable for children, but with modifications. Warm seawater pool immersion at moderate temperatures is generally safe for children over the age of 3, provided they are supervised by a parent and the pool temperature does not exceed 34°C. However, saunas, steam rooms, intense hydromassage jets, and treatments involving concentrated algae or mud products are generally not recommended for young children. Marine aerosol therapy (inhaling seawater mist) is sometimes used for children with respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic sinusitis, but this should be done under medical supervision. Always consult a pediatrician before any thalassotherapy treatment for a child.</p>

<h3>Is the Mediterranean Sea clean enough for thalassotherapy in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s coastal waters are among the cleanest in the Mediterranean, with the vast majority of the island''s beaches holding Blue Flag or similar quality certifications. The Balearic Islands benefit from strong environmental protection regulations, relatively low levels of industrial pollution, and excellent waste water treatment infrastructure. Professional thalassotherapy centres like the Elba Sunset pump seawater from optimal locations and filter it to clinical standards before use, ensuring that the water used in treatments meets strict hygiene requirements. For natural sea swimming, Mallorca''s water quality is regularly tested by the Balearic Islands government and the European Environment Agency, with results publicly available.</p>

<h3>Can thalassotherapy help with weight loss?</h3>
<p>Thalassotherapy is not a weight loss treatment per se, and any claims of significant fat reduction from seawater immersion alone should be viewed with scepticism. However, thalassotherapy may support a weight management programme in several indirect ways: warm seawater exercise burns calories while being gentler on joints than land-based exercise (ideal for overweight individuals); algae wraps may temporarily reduce the appearance of water retention; the magnesium in seawater can improve sleep quality, which is linked to healthier weight management; and the stress-reducing effects of thalassotherapy can help combat stress-related eating. Some thalassotherapy centres offer weight management programmes that combine seawater treatments with nutritional counselling and guided exercise.</p>

<h3>What should I bring to a thalassotherapy session?</h3>
<p>Most thalassotherapy centres provide robes, towels, and slippers. You should bring a swimsuit (required for pool areas), flip-flops or waterproof sandals, a change of underwear, basic toiletries, a water bottle (hydration is essential), and any medical information relevant to your treatment (medication list, doctor''s notes for specific conditions). Avoid wearing jewellery, as the minerals in seawater can tarnish metals. If you wear contact lenses, consider switching to glasses for your visit, as the salt and mineral content of the water can irritate eyes if splashed. Arrive without heavy makeup or perfume, as these can interfere with treatments and contaminate pool water.</p>

<h3>Is thalassotherapy covered by health insurance in Spain?</h3>
<p>In Spain, thalassotherapy is generally not covered by public health insurance (Seguridad Social) or standard private health insurance policies. However, some private insurance plans that include wellness or complementary therapy benefits may partially cover thalassotherapy treatments prescribed by a doctor for specific medical conditions. In France, certain thalassotherapy programmes prescribed by a physician are partially reimbursed by social security — a model that Spain has not yet adopted. If you have private health insurance, check your policy for coverage of "hydrotherapy," "balneotherapy," or "complementary therapies," as thalassotherapy may fall under these categories.</p>
