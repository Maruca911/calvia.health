<p>Finding a trusted <strong>pediatrician in Mallorca</strong> is one of the first priorities for families moving to the island. Whether you are an expat settling in Calvia or a long-term resident looking for better care, Mallorca offers excellent pediatric services, many with English-speaking doctors who understand the unique needs of international families.</p>

<p>This guide covers every aspect of children''s healthcare in Mallorca — from choosing the right pediatrician and understanding the Spanish vaccination schedule, to navigating emergency care and managing common childhood health concerns specific to island life. Our aim is to give you the confidence to make informed decisions about your child''s health in your new home.</p>

<h2>Pediatric Healthcare in Mallorca: Public vs. Private</h2>
<p>Spain operates a dual healthcare system — public (covered by social security contributions) and private. For pediatric care, both systems provide high-quality treatment, but they differ significantly in access, wait times, language options, and flexibility.</p>

<h3>Public Pediatric Care (Seguridad Social)</h3>
<p>In the public system, every child registered with social security is assigned a pediatrician at their local health center (centro de salud). Key characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Free for all registered residents and their dependents</li>
<li>Assigned pediatrician based on your registered address</li>
<li>Appointments typically available within 1 to 3 days for non-urgent issues</li>
<li>Specialist referrals must go through your assigned pediatrician</li>
<li>Consultations primarily in Spanish and Catalan</li>
<li>Well-child check-ups follow the Balearic Islands health program schedule</li>
<li>Vaccinations included at no additional cost</li>
</ul>
<p>The quality of care in the Spanish public system is excellent — Spain''s healthcare system is ranked 7th globally by the World Health Organization. However, for expat families who do not speak Spanish fluently, the language barrier can be a significant challenge, particularly when discussing symptoms, developmental concerns, or treatment options for your child.</p>

<h3>Private Pediatric Care</h3>
<p>The private system offers greater choice and convenience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose your own pediatrician based on language, location, and approach</li>
<li>Same-day or next-day appointments typically available</li>
<li>Longer consultation times (15 to 30 minutes vs. 5 to 10 minutes in public)</li>
<li>Direct access to specialists without GP referral</li>
<li>Multilingual doctors (English, German, French, Swedish common in Calvia area)</li>
<li>Digital appointment booking, teleconsultation, and online medical records</li>
<li>Evening and weekend availability at many practices</li>
</ul>
<p>For families in Calvia, the private route is popular due to the availability of multilingual doctors and the convenience of clinics located throughout the municipality — from Portals Nous and Bendinat to Santa Ponsa and Peguera.</p>

<h2>Types of Pediatric Services Available</h2>

<h3>Well-Child Visits (Revisiones del Nino Sano)</h3>
<p>The Spanish pediatric schedule includes regular check-ups that track growth, development, nutrition, and include the vaccination schedule. The Balearic Islands follow this recommended schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newborn (first week of life)</li>
<li>1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months</li>
<li>9 months (additional in some programs)</li>
<li>12 months, 15 months, 18 months</li>
<li>2 years, 3 years, 4 years</li>
<li>6 years (school entry check)</li>
<li>8, 10, 12, and 14 years</li>
</ul>
<p>Each visit includes measurement of height, weight, and head circumference (for infants), developmental milestone assessment, nutritional guidance, vision and hearing screening at appropriate ages, and discussion of any parental concerns. These visits are essential for early detection of developmental delays, growth issues, and other health concerns.</p>

<h3>Sick Visits and Acute Care</h3>
<p>Most private pediatricians in Calvia offer same-day or next-day appointments for sick children. Common childhood illnesses treated include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upper respiratory infections (colds, croup, bronchiolitis)</li>
<li>Ear infections (otitis media) — the most common reason for pediatric antibiotic prescriptions</li>
<li>Gastroenteritis (stomach flu) — particularly common in summer months</li>
<li>Hand, foot, and mouth disease</li>
<li>Skin conditions (eczema, impetigo, fungal infections)</li>
<li>Allergic reactions (including food allergies and insect stings)</li>
<li>Febrile seizures (fever-related convulsions, which can be frightening but are usually benign)</li>
<li>Urinary tract infections</li>
</ul>
<p>Many clinics also offer telephone or video consultations for minor concerns, which can be particularly useful for assessing whether a clinic visit is necessary — saving time and reducing exposure to other sick children in waiting rooms.</p>

<h3>Emergency Pediatric Care</h3>
<p>For serious situations, know these emergency resources in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>112:</strong> Spain''s universal emergency number (equivalent to 911 or 999). Operators speak multiple languages.</li>
<li><strong>Hospital Universitari Son Espases:</strong> Mallorca''s main public hospital has a dedicated pediatric emergency department staffed 24/7. This is the reference hospital for serious pediatric emergencies.</li>
<li><strong>Hospital Juaneda Miramar:</strong> Private hospital with pediatric emergency services.</li>
<li><strong>Clinica Rotger:</strong> Private facility with emergency department.</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-life-threatening after-hours concerns, the PAC (Punto de Atencion Continuada) urgent care centers in Calvia provide evening, night, and weekend coverage. Your centro de salud can direct you to the nearest PAC.</p>

<h3>Specialist Pediatric Care</h3>
<p>Mallorca has pediatric specialists covering all major areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pediatric allergology:</strong> Essential in Mallorca where pollen allergies are common</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric cardiology:</strong> For heart murmurs and congenital conditions</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric dermatology:</strong> Eczema, birthmarks, and sun-related skin concerns</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric endocrinology:</strong> Growth disorders, thyroid issues, early puberty</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric gastroenterology:</strong> Food intolerances, celiac disease, chronic digestive issues</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric neurology:</strong> Seizures, headaches, developmental disorders</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric orthopedics:</strong> Flat feet, scoliosis, sports injuries</li>
<li><strong>Child psychology and psychiatry:</strong> Anxiety, ADHD, behavioral issues, adjustment difficulties</li>
<li><strong>Pediatric speech therapy (logopedia):</strong> Language delays, bilingual development concerns, articulation issues</li>
</ul>
<p>In the private system, you can access specialists directly. In the public system, referrals come through your assigned pediatrician. Wait times for public specialist appointments range from 2 weeks to several months depending on specialty and urgency.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Pediatrician in Calvia</h2>
<p>Finding the right match for your family involves several important considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language:</strong> Ensure the pediatrician speaks your preferred language well enough to discuss medical concepts, developmental concerns, and treatment options in detail. In the Calvia area, many pediatricians speak English, German, and French in addition to Spanish and Catalan. Test the language capability during your first consultation.</li>
<li><strong>Location and accessibility:</strong> Consider proximity to your home and your children''s school. Also verify parking availability and public transport access. Check evening and weekend availability for those inevitable after-hours illnesses.</li>
<li><strong>Philosophy of care:</strong> Some pediatricians favor a conservative approach (watchful waiting, fewer antibiotics, emphasis on natural recovery), while others are more interventionist. Neither is wrong — it depends on your family''s values and comfort level. Discuss the doctor''s approach during your first visit.</li>
<li><strong>Hospital affiliations:</strong> Know which hospitals your pediatrician works with and has admitting privileges at. If your child needs hospitalization, your familiar doctor can continue to manage care.</li>
<li><strong>Clinic environment:</strong> Visit the clinic before your first appointment if possible. Is the waiting room child-friendly? Is it separated from sick and well-child areas? Are the facilities clean and welcoming?</li>
<li><strong>Digital capabilities:</strong> Can you book appointments online? Does the clinic offer teleconsultation? Can you access your child''s medical records digitally? These features add significant convenience for busy families.</li>
<li><strong>Parent community recommendations:</strong> The expat community in Calvia is well connected. Parent groups on social media, WhatsApp groups, and communities at international schools are excellent sources of genuine, tested recommendations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Vaccination in Mallorca</h2>
<p>Spain has a comprehensive childhood vaccination schedule that is largely aligned with WHO and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) recommendations. The Balearic Islands follow the national schedule with some regional additions.</p>

<h3>The Spanish Vaccination Schedule (2024-2025)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Birth:</strong> Hepatitis B (first dose)</li>
<li><strong>2 months:</strong> DTPa-IPV-Hib-HepB (hexavalent), Pneumococcal (PCV13), Rotavirus (oral), Meningococcal B</li>
<li><strong>4 months:</strong> DTPa-IPV-Hib-HepB, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, Meningococcal B</li>
<li><strong>6 months:</strong> Meningococcal B (third dose)</li>
<li><strong>11 months:</strong> DTPa-IPV-Hib-HepB (booster), Pneumococcal (booster)</li>
<li><strong>12 months:</strong> MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), Meningococcal C, Meningococcal B (booster)</li>
<li><strong>15 months:</strong> Varicella (chickenpox, first dose)</li>
<li><strong>3-4 years:</strong> MMR (second dose), Varicella (second dose)</li>
<li><strong>6 years:</strong> DTPa-IPV booster</li>
<li><strong>12 years:</strong> HPV (human papillomavirus, for both boys and girls), Meningococcal ACWY, Tdap booster</li>
<li><strong>14 years:</strong> Meningococcal ACWY (if not given at 12)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Transferring Vaccination Records</h3>
<p>If your child has been vaccinated in another country, bring their vaccination records (ideally translated into Spanish if not in English). Your pediatrician will review them and integrate your child into the Spanish schedule, adding any missing vaccines. Spain''s schedule is broadly similar to those in the UK, Germany, and other EU countries, but there may be differences in timing or specific vaccines used. For example, the UK does not routinely vaccinate against Meningococcal B at the same schedule, and some countries do not include rotavirus in their standard program.</p>

<p>The WHO recommends that children who move between countries should have their vaccination status reviewed by a local healthcare professional as soon as possible to identify and fill any gaps.</p>

<h2>Common Childhood Health Concerns in Mallorca</h2>

<h3>Sun Protection for Children</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s strong Mediterranean sun requires diligent protection. The Spanish Association of Pediatrics (AEP) and the WHO recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPF 50+ broad-spectrum sunscreen for all children over 6 months, reapplied every 2 hours and after swimming</li>
<li>Infants under 6 months should be kept out of direct sunlight entirely</li>
<li>Protective clothing including wide-brimmed hats and UV-protective swimwear</li>
<li>Avoid direct sun exposure between 12:00 and 16:00 during summer months (UV index regularly exceeds 9 in Mallorca)</li>
<li>Quality UV-blocking sunglasses appropriate for children</li>
</ul>
<p>Sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of skin cancer later in life. The Skin Cancer Foundation notes that even one blistering sunburn in childhood more than doubles the risk of melanoma.</p>

<h3>Allergies in Mallorca</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s diverse plant life means allergies are common among children. Key allergens by season:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>February to April:</strong> Cypress and parietaria (wall pellitory) — parietaria is year-round in mild winters</li>
<li><strong>March to June:</strong> Olive tree pollen — the primary allergen in the Balearic Islands</li>
<li><strong>April to July:</strong> Grass pollen</li>
<li><strong>Summer:</strong> Dust mites increase with humidity</li>
<li><strong>Year-round:</strong> Mold spores, pet dander</li>
</ul>
<p>If your child develops persistent nasal congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes, or wheezing, your pediatrician can arrange allergy testing (skin prick tests or blood tests) and recommend treatment including antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, or immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual drops).</p>

<h3>Water Safety</h3>
<p>With swimming pools and beaches being central to Mallorcan life, water safety is paramount. Drowning is one of the leading causes of accidental death in children aged 1 to 4, according to the WHO. Your pediatrician can advise on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Age-appropriate swimming instruction (recommended from age 4, though water familiarization can start earlier)</li>
<li>Pool fencing requirements (mandatory for private pools in Spain under certain regulations)</li>
<li>Beach safety — understanding flag systems and rip currents</li>
<li>Never leaving children unsupervised near water, even for a moment</li>
<li>CPR training for parents (courses available through the Red Cross in Palma)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Insect Bites and Stings</h3>
<p>Tiger mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) are present in Mallorca and bite during daylight hours. Processionary pine caterpillars (January to April) are a serious health hazard — their tiny hairs cause severe allergic reactions in children and pets. Your pediatrician can advise on prevention and treatment.</p>

<h3>Bilingual Language Development</h3>
<p>Many expat children in Mallorca grow up in multilingual environments (English at home, Spanish and Catalan at school, perhaps other languages with friends). This is entirely normal and beneficial for cognitive development. However, some parents worry about perceived language delays. Research consistently shows that bilingual children may take slightly longer to reach language milestones but ultimately have richer vocabularies and better cognitive flexibility. If you have concerns, a pediatric speech therapist (logopeda) experienced with bilingual children can provide assessment and reassurance or intervention if needed.</p>

<h2>Child Mental Health Services in Mallorca</h2>
<p>The transition to life in a new country can be challenging for children. Common issues include adjustment difficulties, separation anxiety, social integration struggles, and grief for friendships left behind. Mallorca has several English-speaking child psychologists and therapists experienced with expat family issues.</p>

<p>Signs that your child might benefit from professional support include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities they previously enjoyed, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, declining school performance, excessive worry, and behavioral changes. Your pediatrician can provide referrals to appropriate specialists.</p>

<h2>What to Expect at Your First Pediatric Visit</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Medical history review:</strong> Bring all previous medical records, vaccination certificates, growth charts, and any relevant test results from your home country. Having these translated into Spanish or English (if originally in another language) speeds up the process.</li>
<li><strong>Physical examination:</strong> A thorough check-up including height, weight, head circumference (for infants), blood pressure (from age 3), vision screening, hearing assessment, and developmental evaluation appropriate to your child''s age.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion of concerns:</strong> Your opportunity to discuss any health concerns, developmental questions, dietary issues, sleep problems, behavioral observations, or school-related health needs.</li>
<li><strong>Care plan establishment:</strong> Your pediatrician will outline a care plan including upcoming vaccinations, recommended screenings, and the schedule for future visits.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency protocols:</strong> Establish clear guidelines for when to call the clinic, when to go to urgent care, and when to go directly to the emergency department.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Costs of Pediatric Care in Mallorca</h2>
<p>Private pediatric consultations in Calvia typically cost (prices are approximate and may vary by clinic):</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard consultation: 60 to 100 euros</li>
<li>Extended or first-visit consultation: 80 to 150 euros</li>
<li>Home visit: 100 to 200 euros</li>
<li>Telephone or video consultation: 30 to 50 euros</li>
<li>Vaccinations: 40 to 100 euros per vaccine (the vaccine itself plus administration fee)</li>
<li>Allergy testing (skin prick panel): 80 to 150 euros</li>
<li>Blood tests: 30 to 80 euros depending on panel</li>
</ul>
<p>With private health insurance (Sanitas, Asisa, Adeslas, DKV), most consultations and vaccinations are covered with minimal or no co-pay. Insurance premiums for children are typically the lowest in the family, ranging from 30 to 60 euros per month depending on the plan.</p>

<h2>School Health Requirements in Mallorca</h2>
<p>Spanish schools (both public and private/international) require:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vaccination record (cartilla de vacunacion):</strong> Required at enrollment. While vaccination is not legally mandatory in Spain, schools require documentation of vaccination status.</li>
<li><strong>Allergy and medical condition documentation:</strong> Schools need to know about any allergies (food, medication, insect stings), chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes, epilepsy), and emergency medication requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency action plans:</strong> For children with conditions like severe allergies (requiring EpiPen) or asthma, a written action plan from your pediatrician should be provided to the school.</li>
<li><strong>International schools:</strong> May have additional requirements including a full medical examination report, dental check documentation, and specific form formats from your pediatrician.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I find an English-speaking pediatrician in Calvia?</h3>
<p>Yes. The Calvia area, particularly Santa Ponsa, Portals Nous, and Bendinat, has several pediatric practices with English-speaking doctors. International hospitals in Palma also offer multilingual pediatric care. When booking, confirm the specific doctor (not just the reception staff) speaks your language.</p>

<h3>Do I need to register with the public health system?</h3>
<p>If you are a legal resident paying into social security (or a dependent of someone who is), you are entitled to free public pediatric care. Many families use both systems — public for routine care and vaccinations (free), and private for convenience, specialist access, and English-speaking consultations.</p>

<h3>What about house calls for sick children?</h3>
<p>Several private pediatricians in Calvia offer home visits, which is particularly useful for very young children, high fevers, or when multiple siblings are ill simultaneously. Costs are higher than office visits (100 to 200 euros) but many parents find the convenience invaluable — especially avoiding waiting rooms full of other sick children.</p>

<h3>How do school health requirements work in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Spanish schools require proof of vaccination (cartilla de vacunacion) at enrollment. International schools may have additional health form requirements, medical examination reports, and specific immunization documentation. Your pediatrician can prepare all necessary paperwork, often within 1 to 2 appointments.</p>

<h3>Is there a pediatric dentist in the Calvia area?</h3>
<p>Yes, several dental clinics in Calvia offer pediatric dentistry (odontopediatria) with dentists trained to work with children. The PADI program provides free basic dental care for children aged 6 to 15 through the public system. For more information, see our guide to <a href="/blog/best-dentist-mallorca">finding a dentist in Mallorca</a>.</p>

<h3>What if my child needs hospitalization?</h3>
<p>Hospital Universitari Son Espases has a dedicated pediatric ward and pediatric ICU. Private hospitals including Juaneda Miramar also provide pediatric inpatient care. If your private pediatrician has admitting privileges, they can continue managing your child''s care during hospitalization. For children with private insurance, a parent can typically stay overnight in the child''s room at no additional cost.</p>

<h3>How do I get prescriptions for my child in Spain?</h3>
<p>Your pediatrician issues a prescription (receta) which you take to any pharmacy (farmacia). Spanish pharmacies are highly accessible — every town in Calvia has at least one, and there is always a pharmacy on duty (farmacia de guardia) for nights, weekends, and holidays. Many common pediatric medications are available over the counter (fever reducers, cough medicine, antihistamines), and pharmacists in Spain are highly trained and can provide advice on minor childhood ailments.</p>
