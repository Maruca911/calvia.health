<h2>Understanding the Herbolario Tradition in Spain</h2>

<p>Walk through any town in Mallorca and you will likely encounter a <strong>herbolario</strong>—a traditional Spanish herbalist shop that has been a cornerstone of natural health in Spain for centuries. These shops, which blend ancient herbal wisdom with modern natural health products, offer a shopping experience quite different from the health food stores many expats are accustomed to in the UK, Germany, or Scandinavia.</p>

<p>The herbolario tradition in Spain dates back to the medieval period when herbalists (<em>herbolarios</em> or <em>yerberos</em>) served as primary healthcare providers in many communities. While modern medicine has rightly taken centre stage, herbolarios have evolved into sophisticated natural health retailers offering everything from traditional herbal teas (<em>infusiones</em>) and tinctures to cutting-edge nutritional supplements, organic skincare, and speciality dietary products.</p>

<p>In the Calvia region of southwest Mallorca—home to a large international community spanning Santa Ponsa, Palmanova, Portals Nous, Peguera, and beyond—you will find herbolarios and natural health shops that cater to a multilingual clientele. Many shop owners speak English and German alongside Spanish and Catalan, and they stock products familiar to expats from across Europe.</p>

<p>What makes shopping at a Spanish herbolario distinctive is the personalised service. Unlike large chain health food stores, most herbolarios employ knowledgeable staff, often with formal training in herbalism or nutrition, who can guide you through product selection. They will ask about your health goals, medications, and allergies before recommending products—a level of care that many expats find refreshing.</p>

<h2>Best Natural Health Shops in the Calvia Area</h2>

<h3>Herbolarios and Specialist Natural Health Shops</h3>

<p>The Calvia municipality benefits from a good selection of natural health retailers. While specific shop availability may change, the types of establishments you can expect to find include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional herbolarios:</strong> Found in Santa Ponsa, Palmanova, and Calvia village, these shops focus on herbal remedies, teas, tinctures, natural supplements, and homeopathic products. Staff often have herbalism qualifications and can provide detailed guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Organic supermarkets and health food shops:</strong> Chains like Naturasi and independent organic shops offer a broader range including organic groceries, gluten-free products, vegan foods, and natural household products alongside supplements and remedies.</li>
<li><strong>Pharmacy natural sections:</strong> Many Spanish pharmacies (<em>farmacias</em>) have expanded their natural health sections significantly. You can find quality supplements, probiotics, and herbal products in pharmacies throughout Calvia, with the added assurance of pharmaceutical-grade quality control and professional advice from pharmacists.</li>
<li><strong>Asian health shops:</strong> Several shops in Palma (a short drive from Calvia) specialise in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) products, Ayurvedic herbs, and Asian health foods.</li>
<li><strong>Eco and zero-waste shops:</strong> A growing trend in Mallorca, these shops offer bulk natural products, reducing packaging waste while providing quality herbs, spices, and natural remedies.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Palma as a Resource</h3>
<p>While Calvia has good local options, the capital city of Palma—just 20-30 minutes'' drive—offers a much wider selection. The old town area and the Santa Catalina market neighbourhood have particularly good concentrations of herbolarios, organic shops, and speciality health food stores. If you''re looking for hard-to-find products, a trip to Palma is well worth the journey.</p>

<h2>Supplement Regulation in Spain: What You Need to Know</h2>

<h3>The Regulatory Framework</h3>
<p>Understanding how supplements are regulated in Spain is crucial for making safe and informed purchasing decisions. The regulatory landscape differs significantly from the UK and US, and these differences matter for your health and safety.</p>

<p>In Spain, food supplements (<em>complementos alimenticios</em>) are regulated primarily by:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>AESAN (Agencia Espanola de Seguridad Alimentaria y Nutricion):</strong> The Spanish Food Safety Agency oversees food supplement regulations, labelling requirements, and safety standards. Formerly known as AECOSAN, this agency is part of the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.</li>
<li><strong>AEMPS (Agencia Espanola de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios):</strong> The Spanish Medicines Agency regulates products that make medicinal claims. If a natural product claims to treat, cure, or prevent a disease, it must be registered as a medicine with AEMPS, not sold as a food supplement.</li>
<li><strong>EU Regulation 2015/2283 (Novel Foods):</strong> Any ingredient not traditionally consumed in the EU before May 1997 must undergo a safety assessment before being sold. This means some supplements available in the US (such as certain mushroom extracts or newer compounds) may not be legally sold in Spain.</li>
<li><strong>EU Directive 2002/46/EC:</strong> The foundational EU directive on food supplements, setting maximum and minimum levels for vitamins and minerals and establishing labelling requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Spanish Regulation Differs from the UK and US</h3>

<p><strong>Compared to the UK:</strong> Since Brexit, UK supplement regulations have diverged somewhat from EU rules, though many standards remain similar. Some products available in UK health food shops may not be available in Spain if they contain Novel Food ingredients not approved in the EU. Conversely, some traditional European herbal preparations are more readily available in Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Compared to the US:</strong> The difference is more stark. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates supplements under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which places the burden of proof on the FDA to show a product is unsafe, rather than requiring manufacturers to prove safety before sale. In the EU and Spain, supplement ingredients must be from approved lists, and maximum dosages are more strictly controlled. This means some high-dose supplements popular in the US (such as mega-dose vitamins or certain herbal extracts) may not be available or may be available at lower dosages in Spain.</p>

<h3>Quality Certifications to Look For</h3>

<p>When purchasing supplements and natural products in Mallorca, these certifications indicate quality and safety:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice):</strong> Ensures the product was manufactured under strict quality-control conditions. Look for GMP certification on supplement labels.</li>
<li><strong>EU Organic Logo (green leaf):</strong> The official EU organic certification, indicating the product meets strict organic production standards. This is regulated under EU Regulation 2018/848.</li>
<li><strong>COSMOS (COSMetic Organic and Natural Standard):</strong> For natural and organic cosmetics and personal care products. COSMOS Natural and COSMOS Organic are the two levels of certification.</li>
<li><strong>CAIB (Consell Balear de la Produccio Agraria Ecologica):</strong> The Balearic Islands'' own organic certification body for locally produced organic products.</li>
<li><strong>Bio / Eco label:</strong> In Spain, both "bio" and "eco" are legally protected terms that can only be used for certified organic products.</li>
<li><strong>NSF International:</strong> An independent certification particularly relevant for sports supplements, ensuring products are free from banned substances.</li>
<li><strong>Informed Sport:</strong> Another third-party certification for sports supplements, testing for substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Supplement-Medication Interactions</h2>

<p>One of the most critical safety concerns with natural health products is their potential to interact with prescription medications. This is especially important for expats who may be taking medications prescribed in different countries and purchasing supplements locally. Here are key interactions to be aware of:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Fish oil / Omega-3 + Blood thinners (Warfarin, Sintrom, Heparin):</strong> Omega-3 fatty acids can enhance the blood-thinning effect, potentially increasing bleeding risk. Always inform your doctor if you''re taking fish oil alongside anticoagulants.</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin E + Blood thinners:</strong> High-dose vitamin E can also increase bleeding risk when combined with anticoagulants.</li>
<li><strong>St John''s Wort (Hierba de San Juan) + Antidepressants, oral contraceptives, blood thinners:</strong> This popular herbal remedy for mild depression is one of the most significant interactors, potentially reducing the effectiveness of many medications or causing serotonin syndrome with SSRIs.</li>
<li><strong>Calcium / Iron + Thyroid medications (Levothyroxine):</strong> These minerals can significantly reduce the absorption of thyroid medication. Take them at least 4 hours apart.</li>
<li><strong>Grapefruit extract + Statins (Atorvastatin, Simvastatin):</strong> Grapefruit compounds inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4, potentially increasing statin levels in the blood to dangerous levels.</li>
<li><strong>Ginkgo biloba + Blood thinners, NSAIDs:</strong> May increase bleeding risk.</li>
<li><strong>Valerian (Valeriana) + Sedatives, alcohol:</strong> Can enhance sedative effects, leading to excessive drowsiness.</li>
<li><strong>Turmeric / Curcumin + Blood thinners, diabetes medications:</strong> May enhance blood-thinning effects and lower blood sugar, requiring medication adjustment.</li>
<li><strong>Magnesium + Antibiotics (Tetracyclines, Fluoroquinolones):</strong> Can reduce antibiotic absorption. Space doses by at least 2-3 hours.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Critical advice:</strong> Always inform your doctor and pharmacist about ALL supplements you take, including herbal teas. In Spain, your pharmacist (<em>farmaceutico</em>) can be an excellent first point of consultation for supplement-medication interactions and many pharmacies now have specific software to check interactions.</p>

<h2>Locally Produced Mallorcan Health Products</h2>

<p>Mallorca has a rich tradition of producing natural health products, and sourcing locally not only supports the island''s economy but also ensures freshness and reduces environmental impact. Here are some notable Mallorcan health products worth seeking out:</p>

<h3>Mallorcan Almond Oil</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s almond orchards, particularly in the Tramuntana region and the central plains, produce exceptional almonds. Cold-pressed Mallorcan almond oil is prized for both culinary and cosmetic use. Rich in vitamin E, oleic acid, and monounsaturated fats, it serves as a natural moisturiser, massage oil, and carrier oil for aromatherapy. Look for <em>aceite de almendras dulces de Mallorca</em> in herbolarios and local markets.</p>

<h3>Mallorcan Honey</h3>
<p>Raw Mallorcan honey (<em>miel de Mallorca</em>), with its Indicacion Geografica Protegida (IGP) status, is produced by bees foraging on the island''s diverse flora including rosemary, thyme, carob, and wildflowers. Different varieties offer varying flavour profiles and purported health properties. Rosemary honey (<em>miel de romero</em>) is particularly valued for its delicate flavour and antioxidant content. Look for raw, unprocessed varieties at local markets and herbolarios.</p>

<h3>Flor de Sal d''Es Trenc</h3>
<p>Hand-harvested sea salt from the Es Trenc salt flats in southeastern Mallorca is rich in trace minerals including magnesium, potassium, and calcium. Unlike refined table salt, this artisanal salt retains its natural mineral profile. It''s available plain or infused with Mediterranean herbs like rosemary, hibiscus, or olive. While salt should be consumed in moderation, choosing mineral-rich, unrefined salt over highly processed alternatives is a simple health upgrade.</p>

<h3>Herbal Teas and Tisanes</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s garrigue landscape produces abundant aromatic and medicinal herbs. Locally harvested chamomile (<em>manzanilla</em>), rosemary (<em>romero</em>), thyme (<em>tomillo</em>), lavender (<em>lavanda</em>), and lemon verbena (<em>hierba luisa</em>) are available dried in herbolarios and at farmers'' markets. These herbs form the basis of traditional Mallorcan herbal medicine and offer a genuinely local, sustainable alternative to imported products.</p>

<h3>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</h3>
<p>Olive oil is perhaps the most significant health product of the Mediterranean. Mallorcan olive oil has its own Denominacion de Origen Protegida (DOP) - Oli de Mallorca - guaranteeing quality and origin. The island''s olive oil is particularly rich in polyphenols and antioxidants, with a distinctive peppery, slightly bitter flavour profile. Regular consumption of high-quality extra-virgin olive oil is associated with cardiovascular protection, anti-inflammatory effects, and cognitive health benefits, as demonstrated in the PREDIMED study.</p>

<h2>Comprehensive Supplement Buying Guide by Health Concern</h2>

<h3>Joint Health</h3>
<p>Joint health is a common concern, particularly among older expats and active individuals. Evidence-supported supplements available in Mallorcan health shops include glucosamine sulphate (1,500mg daily), chondroitin (800-1,200mg daily), collagen peptides (10g daily), omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), and turmeric/curcumin with piperine for absorption. Look for products with bioavailability-enhancing formulations. Note that glucosamine is typically derived from shellfish—if you have a shellfish allergy, seek vegan alternatives made from fermented corn.</p>

<h3>Sleep Support</h3>
<p>Adjusting to a new time zone, different light patterns, and the lifestyle changes of relocation can disrupt sleep. Natural sleep support options available in herbolarios include melatonin (available over the counter in Spain, typically 1-2mg, though EU regulations limit this), valerian root (<em>valeriana</em>), passionflower (<em>pasiflora</em>), lemon balm (<em>melisa</em>), magnesium glycinate (200-400mg before bed), and L-theanine. Combination formulas are popular and often effective.</p>

<h3>Immune Support</h3>
<p>Maintaining robust immunity is important, especially during the winter months when respiratory viruses circulate. Evidence-based immune support includes vitamin D3 (1,000-2,000 IU daily, or as directed by blood test results), vitamin C (500-1,000mg daily), zinc (15-25mg daily, for short periods), elderberry (<em>sauco</em>) extract, and probiotic strains with immune evidence (such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG). Beta-glucans from medicinal mushrooms are increasingly popular but verify they comply with EU Novel Food regulations.</p>

<h3>Digestive Health</h3>
<p>Multi-strain probiotics with clinically studied strains (look for specific strain designations like Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 or Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12), digestive enzymes, L-glutamine for gut lining support, psyllium husk for fibre, and ginger or peppermint oil capsules for nausea and IBS symptoms are all available in Mallorcan health shops. Fermented foods like kefir, kombucha, and sauerkraut are also increasingly available in organic shops.</p>

<h3>Skin Health</h3>
<p>The Mediterranean sun, while wonderful for mood and vitamin D, can be harsh on skin. Oral supplements that may support skin health include collagen peptides, hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, astaxanthin (a potent antioxidant), and evening primrose oil (<em>aceite de onagra</em>), which is particularly popular in Spanish herbolarios for skin and hormonal health.</p>

<h3>Energy and Vitality</h3>
<p>Iron (if deficient—always test first), B-complex vitamins, CoQ10 (particularly if taking statins), magnesium, ashwagandha (check EU Novel Food status), and Rhodiola rosea are commonly sought for energy support. Royal jelly (<em>jalea real</em>) is extremely popular in Spain for energy and vitality and is widely available in herbolarios and pharmacies.</p>

<h2>Essential Oils Guide</h2>

<h3>Quality Markers for Essential Oils</h3>
<p>Essential oils have become extremely popular, but quality varies enormously. When shopping in Mallorca, look for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Latin botanical name</strong> on the label (e.g., Lavandula angustifolia, not just "lavender")</li>
<li><strong>Country of origin</strong> clearly stated</li>
<li><strong>Extraction method</strong> specified (steam distillation, cold pressing, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>100% pure</strong> designation with no synthetic additives</li>
<li><strong>Chemotype</strong> where relevant (e.g., Thymus vulgaris ct. linalool vs ct. thymol)</li>
<li><strong>Dark glass bottles</strong> to protect from light degradation</li>
<li><strong>Batch number and expiry date</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Locally Relevant Essential Oils</h3>
<p>Mallorca''s landscape and climate produce or inspire several notable essential oils:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rosemary (Romero):</strong> Abundant in Mallorca''s garrigue. Used for mental clarity, circulation, and muscle pain.</li>
<li><strong>Lavender (Lavanda):</strong> While not as extensively cultivated as in Provence, Mallorcan lavender is available and prized for relaxation and sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Lemon (Limon):</strong> Made from Mallorcan lemon peel by cold pressing. Uplifting, cleansing, and useful in household cleaning products.</li>
<li><strong>Orange (Naranja):</strong> Mallorca''s abundant orange trees provide material for sweet orange oil, valued for anxiety and mood.</li>
<li><strong>Thyme (Tomillo):</strong> Wild thyme grows prolifically on the island. The oil is powerful and antimicrobial but must be used with caution (always dilute, not for use on children).</li>
<li><strong>Pine (Pino):</strong> From the Aleppo pines common across Mallorca. Respiratory support and decongestant properties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Essential Oil Safety</h3>
<p>Essential oils are concentrated plant compounds and must be used responsibly. Never apply undiluted essential oils to skin (except lavender and tea tree in specific circumstances). Do not ingest essential oils unless under the direct supervision of a qualified aromatherapist or doctor. Keep away from children and pets. Some oils are photosensitising (especially citrus oils)—avoid sun exposure after topical application. If pregnant or breastfeeding, consult a qualified practitioner before using any essential oils.</p>

<h2>Homeopathy in Spain</h2>

<p>Homeopathy has a long history and significant popularity in Spain. You will find homeopathic remedies in most herbolarios and many pharmacies. Leading homeopathic brands like Boiron and Heel are widely stocked. Some medical doctors in Spain hold additional homeopathy qualifications and offer integrative consultations.</p>

<p>It is important to note, however, that the scientific consensus, including positions from the European Academies Science Advisory Council (EASAC) and the UK National Health Service (NHS), is that homeopathic preparations have not been demonstrated to be effective beyond placebo in rigorous clinical trials. The Spanish government has also moved to increase scrutiny of homeopathic products. If you choose to use homeopathy, it should complement, not replace, evidence-based medical treatment for any health condition.</p>

<h2>Natural Cosmetics and Personal Care</h2>

<p>The natural and organic cosmetics market has exploded in Mallorca, driven by both local and international demand. You can find excellent natural personal care products in herbolarios, organic shops, and even some supermarkets. Key certifications to look for include COSMOS Organic, COSMOS Natural, NATRUE, and ECOCERT. Spanish natural cosmetic brands like Matarrania (from Aragon, using olive oil as a base), Plante System, and Naay Botanicals offer high-quality options, alongside international brands like Weleda, Dr. Hauschka, and Lavera which are widely available.</p>

<p>Several Mallorcan artisans produce handmade natural soaps, body oils, and skincare using local ingredients like almond oil, olive oil, carob, and sea salt. These make wonderful products for personal use and gifts, and you can often find them at local markets and craft fairs.</p>

<h2>Online Ordering Options for Mallorca</h2>

<p>If you cannot find specific products locally, several reputable online retailers deliver to Mallorca:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Herbolario Navarro (herbolarionavarro.com):</strong> One of Spain''s oldest and most trusted herbolarios, with a comprehensive online shop.</li>
<li><strong>Planeta Huerto (planetahuerto.es):</strong> Excellent Spanish online retailer for organic foods, supplements, gardening, and natural products.</li>
<li><strong>iHerb:</strong> International supplement retailer that ships to Spain, though customs may apply for orders over certain thresholds, and some products may not comply with EU regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Amazon.es:</strong> Increasingly stocks natural health products, though quality control is less rigorous than specialist retailers. Stick to known brands and verified sellers.</li>
<li><strong>Farmacia online:</strong> Licensed Spanish online pharmacies like PromoFarma offer pharmacy-grade supplements with professional-quality assurance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Be cautious when ordering from outside the EU—customs regulations may delay or block shipments of supplements containing ingredients not approved under EU Novel Food regulations. Products from the US are particularly likely to encounter issues.</p>

<h2>Farmers Markets in the Calvia Area</h2>

<p>For the freshest natural products, Mallorca''s weekly farmers'' markets (<em>mercados</em>) are unbeatable. In the Calvia area, key markets include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Santa Ponsa Monday Market:</strong> A vibrant market offering fresh fruits and vegetables, local honey, olive oil, herbal teas, artisanal soaps, and dried herbs. Open Monday mornings.</li>
<li><strong>Andratx Wednesday Market:</strong> One of the larger markets in southwest Mallorca, with excellent local produce, nuts, dried fruits, and natural products. Wednesday mornings.</li>
<li><strong>Calvia Village Market:</strong> A smaller but charming market in the village centre, with local organic produce and artisanal products.</li>
<li><strong>Palmanova / Son Ferrer Markets:</strong> Regular markets offering a mix of fresh produce and natural health products.</li>
</ul>

<p>When shopping at markets, look for stalls with organic certification (<em>ecologico</em>) signage. Many small Mallorcan farmers practice organic methods even without formal certification—don''t hesitate to ask about growing practices.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Are supplements cheaper in Spain than the UK or Germany?</h3>
<p>Supplement pricing in Spain is generally comparable to other EU countries, though there are some differences. Common vitamins and minerals tend to be slightly cheaper in Spain, particularly pharmacy-own brands. Specialist supplements and international premium brands may be similarly priced or slightly more expensive due to distribution costs on the island. The best value is typically found in Spanish pharmacy chains (like offering multi-buy deals on supplements), online Spanish retailers like Planeta Huerto, and during pharmacy promotion weeks (<em>semanas de salud</em>). VAT on food supplements in Spain is 10% (reduced rate), while it is 21% on cosmetics and non-food items.</p>

<h3>Can I bring supplements from the UK to Mallorca?</h3>
<p>For personal use, you can generally bring supplements in your luggage when travelling from the UK to Mallorca. However, post-Brexit, there are considerations. Quantities should be reasonable for personal use (typically a few months'' supply). Products containing ingredients classified as Novel Foods in the EU but approved in the UK may technically be non-compliant. CBD products are particularly problematic as regulations differ between the UK and Spain. In practice, small quantities for personal use rarely cause issues at customs, but avoid bringing large quantities or products that might be confused with controlled substances. If you rely on a specific supplement not available in Spain, consider consulting a local nutritionist for an equivalent EU-compliant alternative.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a herbolario and a pharmacy for supplements?</h3>
<p>Both herbolarios and pharmacies sell supplements in Spain, but there are important differences. Pharmacies (<em>farmacias</em>) are staffed by qualified pharmacists who can advise on interactions with medications, and they tend to stock pharmaceutical-grade supplements from brands like Solgar, Nature''s Bounty, and Arkopharma. Their products undergo rigorous quality testing. Herbolarios offer a wider range of herbal remedies, organic products, and natural health items that you won''t find in pharmacies. Staff typically have herbalism or naturopathy training. For supplements where medication interaction is a concern, start with a pharmacy. For herbal teas, natural remedies, organic foods, and a broader selection of natural brands, the herbolario is your destination.</p>

<h3>Are herbal remedies regulated in Spain?</h3>
<p>Yes, herbal remedies are regulated in Spain under both Spanish national law and EU regulations. Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products (THMPs) can be registered through a simplified EU procedure if they have a documented history of at least 30 years of traditional use (15 years within the EU). These products can make limited health claims based on traditional use. Herbal products sold as food supplements must comply with EU food supplement regulations and can only make authorised health claims (as per the EU health claims register under Regulation 1924/2006). The AEMPS oversees herbal medicines, while AESAN oversees herbal food supplements. Unregistered products making medicinal claims are illegal. Always purchase from reputable herbolarios and pharmacies to ensure regulatory compliance.</p>

<h3>Where can I find CBD oil in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>CBD (cannabidiol) products occupy a legally complex space in Spain. As of the latest regulations, CBD products are available in many herbolarios and specialist shops in Mallorca, but their legal status is nuanced. CBD products are generally sold as "cosmetic" or "aromatic" products rather than food supplements, as the EU Novel Food Catalogue lists CBD extracts as novel foods requiring authorisation. The sale of CBD flowers is tolerated in some contexts but legally grey. If you wish to use CBD products, be aware that quality varies enormously—look for third-party lab testing certificates (Certificates of Analysis), CO2 extraction methods, and clearly stated CBD concentration. Discuss CBD use with your doctor, especially if taking other medications, as CBD can interact with many drugs through the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.</p>

<h3>Do natural health shops in Mallorca cater to vegans?</h3>
<p>Absolutely. The natural health shop scene in Mallorca has embraced vegan products comprehensively. Most herbolarios and organic shops stock plant-based protein powders, vegan vitamin D3 (from lichen), algae-based omega-3 supplements, vegan collagen-boosting supplements, B12 supplements (essential for vegans), and iron supplements from plant sources. You will also find extensive ranges of vegan foods, snacks, and meal ingredients. The V-Label (European Vegetarian Union) and the Vegan Society trademark are commonly seen on products in Mallorca''s health shops. For vegan-specific nutritional advice, several nutritionists in the Calvia area specialise in plant-based nutrition.</p>

<h3>Can I find Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) products in Mallorca?</h3>
<p>Yes, though the selection is more limited than in larger Spanish cities like Barcelona or Madrid. Palma has several TCM practitioners and shops offering Chinese herbal formulas, acupuncture supplies, and related products. Some herbolarios in the Calvia area stock basic TCM products like goji berries, reishi and shiitake mushroom extracts, ginseng, and astragalus. For comprehensive TCM consultation and herbal prescriptions, you will likely need to visit a specialist practitioner in Palma. Ensure any TCM practitioner you visit is properly qualified—look for membership in the Federacion de Profesionales de Medicina Tradicional China (FEMTC) or equivalent professional body.</p>

<h3>What locally produced Mallorcan supplements are worth trying?</h3>
<p>Mallorca produces several notable natural health products worth incorporating into your routine. Raw Mallorcan honey with IGP certification offers natural antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Mallorcan almond oil, cold-pressed from the island''s famous almonds, is excellent for skin, hair, and culinary use. Flor de Sal d''Es Trenc provides mineral-rich artisanal sea salt. Local olive oil with DOP certification is one of the healthiest fats available. Dried Mediterranean herbs from the Mallorcan countryside (rosemary, thyme, lavender) make excellent infusions. Carob products (<em>algarroba</em>) are a traditional Mallorcan superfood rich in fibre, calcium, and antioxidants. Look for these at farmers'' markets and herbolarios for the freshest, most authentic products.</p>
